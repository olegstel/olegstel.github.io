          <h2>Ingradients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugars</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons canola oils</li>
            <li>  6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>

      <li>  In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.
        Add the sugar, salt, oil and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth.
        Stir in enough remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a soft dough.</li>
<li> Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic,
  about 8-10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top.
   Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours.</li>
<li> Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough in half.
  Shape each into a loaf. Place in two greased 9x5-in. loaf pans.
  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30-45 minutes. </li>
<li>Bake at 375Â° for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown and bread sounds
  hollow when tapped. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
  Yield: 2 loaves (16 slices each).</li>
</ol>
